Web Design &amp; Development Project: Year 1


This project was part of the Web Design and Development curriculum. Using HTML and CSS I created simple pages for a website, which included volunteering page with interactive buttons and design features, and a splash screen leading to a website home page. As home page was not my assignment I do not have access to those projects. Overall, this was a fun experience and a great way to cement my knowledge of HTML and CSS without any use of JavaScript.
